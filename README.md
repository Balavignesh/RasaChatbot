 - Extreme difficulty breathing (such as gasping for air, being unable to talk without catching your breath, severe wheezing, nostrils flaring)

 - New disorientation (acting confused)

 - Unconscious or very difficult to wake up

 - Slurred speech or difficulty speaking (new or worsening)

 - New or worsening seizures

 - Signs of low blood pressure (too weak to stand, dizziness, lightheaded, feeling cold, pale, clammy skin)

 - Dehydration (dry lips and mouth, not urinating much, sunken eyes)

  This list does not include all possible symptoms.
